            <p>

            <h2>Mentorship from Professionals</h2>
            <p>
              Each scholarship recipient is paired with a mentors, and a local professional, educator, university student, or community leader—who provides ongoing advice, motivation, and emotional support.
              Mentors help students set goals, overcome challenges, and build confidence. Beyond academic success, students receive practical life skills training—from time management and problem-solving to public speaking and leadership. We also offer career exposure sessions, connecting students to potential career paths and inspiring success stories of fellow Papuans who have broken barriers through education.

            <h2>Educational Scholarships</h2>
            <p>
              In Papua, thousands of children are forced to drop out of school due to financial hardship, lack of educational resources, or the simple inability to afford basic school supplies. Many of these children come from rural areas where education is often seen as a luxury instead of a right.

              Through Papuan Children’s Education (PED), our Educational Scholarship program provides direct financial support to ensure every child has the opportunity to pursue their education, regardless of their economic background. We believe that no dream should be cut short because of poverty.

              <p class="sub">Scholarship Awardee – Universitas Jayapura</p>
              <p>
                Lidia loves fixing things—radios, bicycles, even her family’s old generator.
                But in her village, engineering was seen as a hard and elite job.
                Through a PED Scholarships mentoring program, Lidia found her voice and her passion.
                Now, she’s one of the first girls from her village studying mechanical engineering.
